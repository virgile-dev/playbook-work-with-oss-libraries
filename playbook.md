## How to Collaborate with Open Source Libraries

### 1. **Align with Existing Roadmaps**

Open source libraries thrive when contributions align with their long-term vision. Instead of requesting custom features, fund existing roadmap items. This ensures your investment benefits the entire ecosystem, not just your project.

***

### 2. **Invest in Standardization**

Funding the development of standardized, reusable components creates value for everyone. Prioritize features that solve common problems and can be adopted across industries. Standardization reduces fragmentation and strengthens the library’s impact.

***

### 3. **Support Ongoing Maintenance**

Building a feature is just the beginning. Maintenance—bug fixes, security updates, and documentation—is what keeps a library reliable. Allocate resources for sustained upkeep, not just initial development. (Ex: invest between 30 to 50% of you feature budget in maintenance work)

### 4. **Provide Predictable, Long-Term Funding**

Open source maintainers need stability. Offer multi-year funding commitments or recurring sponsorships. Predictable support allows maintainers to plan, innovate, avoid [burnout](https://dev.to/opensauced/the-silent-crisis-in-open-source-when-maintainers-walk-away-1m81) and reduce [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor). In short: **focus on quality rather than survival**.

***

### 5. **Collaborate Transparently**

Engage directly on public code repositories (GitLab, Forgejo, GitHub etc.). Share your requirements, feedback, and progress openly. Transparency builds trust, attracts more contributors, and ensures alignment with the community’s needs.

***

### 6. **Participate Actively in the Community**

Don’t just fund—contribute. Write issues, submit pull requests, and join discussions. Active participation strengthens the library and demonstrates your commitment to its success.

***

### 7. **Understand and Support Dependencies**

Open source projects rely on other libraries. Audit your dependencies and, where possible, fund their maintenance too. A healthy ecosystem depends on the sustainability of its entire supply chain.
