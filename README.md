## Context around this document?

* [LaSuite Docs](https://github.com/suitenumerique/docs/) is a collaborative note taking and knowledge management product that was built by the French and German government. It's built on top of the following libraries: BlockNote, Yjs and Prosemirror.

* For the [roadmap](https://docs.numerique.gouv.fr/docs/d1d3788e-c619-41ff-abe8-2d079da2f084/) to unfold, we **had to** collaborate with the maintainers of the library above.

* In the process we learnt a few things and decided to put forward an humble draft for a playbook to make the best of collaboration between IT buyers and oss library maintainers.

* We first presented this playbook at [FOSDEM 2026](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/DC97FQ-building_digital_workplace_solutions_on_top_of_foundational_libraries_blocknote_/).

## Why this document?

* Libraries are rarely involved in the IT procurement processes.

* Our products are as good as their underlying libaries.

* Working directly with maintainers and ensure maintainers get a piece of the IT contracting cake ensure that.

* In this document we gather a few ideas on how collaborating with oss maintainers should and could look.

## What's the aim of this document?

* **For maintainers:** address their core needs—sustainability, recognition, and community support.

* **For IT buyers (public or private sector):** provides a clear, actionable framework for responsible and impactful open source engagement.
